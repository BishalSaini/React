# React Learning Project

This project is a learning exercise focused on React development, utilizing React Router for navigation and various React hooks and components.

## Overview

In this project, I've implemented a basic React application to explore React Router, components, and hooks. Below is a breakdown of the key features and concepts covered:

### React Router

- **Purpose**: React Router is used for declarative routing in a React application, allowing navigation between different components based on the URL.
- **Key Components Used**:
  - `<Link>` and `<NavLink>`: Used to create navigation links without page refresh.
  - `<Route>`: Defines routes and associates them with specific components.
  - `<BrowserRouter>`: Provides routing functionality to the application.
  - `<Routes>`: Container for defining multiple routes within the application.

### React Hooks

- **`useState`**: Used to add state to functional components.
- **`useEffect`**: Used for performing side effects in functional components (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
- **`useParams`**: Used to access parameters from the URL in routed components (e.g., retrieving `userId` from the URL path).

### Components

- **Header Component**: Implemented a navigation bar (`Header`) using React Router `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components for routing.
- **Footer Component**: Created a footer (`Footer`) with various links and information.
- **About Component**: A section (`About`) showcasing an image and text content using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following key files and folders:

- `src/`
  - `components/`: Contains React components used throughout the application.
    - `Header.jsx`: Navigation bar component.
    - `Footer.jsx`: Footer component.
    - `About.jsx`: About section component.
  - `main.jsx`: Main application component.


## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
